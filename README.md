# Game Nickname Generator

## Objective
This code will generate a nickname that can be mainly used in games. It has a optional treatment pronoun, a name, which can be chosen or randomized, and a last name, chosen or randomized too.

## How to use
Just copy the script.js file into you code editor.
Once copied, you will see the last four lines as examples.
You have many ways of using it:

  ### Name
    You can choose any name, or you can get a random one by passing 'random' into the function.
    
  ### Last Name
    You can choose any last name, or you can get a random one by passing 'random' into the function.
    
  ### Pronoun
    You can choose any pronoun, or you can get a random one by passing de 'random' string into the function. Or you also can pass nothing and you won't have a pronoun.
    
    
#### This is just a training code, so it's very simple and limited to 36 combinations of Name + Last Name.
